# DB App

## A Flutter Application

This project is a Flutter application designed to manage everyday courier records via a local MySQL database. XAMPP serves as a local server environment, enabling the PHP scripts to interact with the MySQL database. PHP handles server-side logic and facilitates CRUD operations on the database, while Flutter provides a responsive and interactive user interface for seamless data management and display on mobile devices.
